KNOW THE BLOCKS MAVEN is an educational program training Nigerian youth (15- 30 years) and Special Needs Students about the Web3 and Blockchain ecosystems. 

We have a vision of hope that - despite rising unemployment, limited education and financial barriers  - through grassroots education, our youth can believe themselves capable and become active contributors to the future of blockchain and financial sovereignty.

 It is our mission to
 
- deliver knowledge to demystify Web3 and Blockchain technology,
- lower barriers to entry into the Web3 ecosystems  
- empower active engagement in Web3 ecosystems
- promote hope for career development within these new economies
- build a community to underpin a collective vision

Established in 2021 we are guided by values including equality, accessibility, diversity, knowledge sharing and collaboration. We have graduated over 80 students from our basic and intermediate blockchain courses. And now due to recent partnerships, more than 3000 students registered. We seek funding to help resource this huge growth and cater to the massive demand we see for students seeking accessible blockchain education, future career opportunities and  financial freedom and equality.

Success to Date: Six of our Cohort 1 (2021) pilot participants proceeded to the intermediate and master classes and three of them are now core contributors at two Decentralized Autonomous organizations (DAO) namely Aragon Network DAO and Bankless DAO. 

We have now trained over 80 students with 10 graduates currently working with different blockchain companies and projects like Messari, Bankless DAO, Learning Lab, SiS, building different blockchain projects like blockchain clubs and communities, functioning at different capacity, steadily building their careers.

Some of our graduates are back as volunteers in KBM and have also enrolled siblings, creating a chain of financial freedom and emancipation among these young adults.

Applied Learning: KBM DAO

KBMDAO on (testnet) enables student to apply the knowledge gained through I-Learn the Blocks to

- Interact with smart contracts on a blockchain
- Understand the challenges of decentralized autonomous organization  
- Participate in decentralize decision making processes


In the long term, through applied learning we hope to build a DAO Native culture and active governance participation in the next generation. 

Success to Date: Students and community have created a platform where questions are asked, feedback and improvements made and upon which learning, knowledge sharing and collaboration is flourishing.

Community Collaboration & Partnerships

As a community we are intentional about developing collaborative opportunities and establishing mutually beneficial connections as an extension of our education strategy. By leveraging the power of community we further pave the way for realizing our collective vision. There is a need for many ecosystem projects to build community to solve the cold start problem and advance service, product or network strategy, and we work to connect teams that align with our values.

Success to Date: We currently have a community of over 5000 active web3 users,learning and engaging with numerous blockchain ecosystems. Our community consists of current students, graduates and  international exchange students and global web3 enthusiasts.

We have partnered with Metaversiity Florida which offer intermediate and advanced classes on Metaverse and require participants to go through our basic classes. 

Just recently KBM was granted access by the FCT Education Board to the Senior High Schools in Abuja (capital of Nigeria) to establish blockchain clubs piloting the I-Learn the Blocks program with 20 Schools. 

This partnership has seen our course registrations skyrocket with a database of over 3000 students seeking opportunity to discover the opportunities that Web3 brings.
