OUR MOTIVATION
Blockchain is an evolving technology that has come to stay and will grow its tentacles to every industry in the world. Since this is an evolving technology expanding with the speed of light, great need as arisen globally for experts in different careers to offer their services in the Blockchain Ecosystem. And guess what? We have very little of them as at yet. The career paths in the Blockchain Ecosystem is grossly under explored and this is where we come in. We enlighten, teach,train and practically hold these young Nigerians by the hand to becoming a fully fledge expert in whatever career they choose in the Blockchain Ecosystem.
VISION AND MISSION
Our vision for this project is born out of a passion for solving the enormous challenge of unemployment in Nigeria by looking at other niches in the career world that haven’t been “oversaturated” and yet will remain relevant in the next multiple decades. 
Ninety percent out of a Hundred when asked what do you know about the blockchain will mention cryptocurrency, that is the Bitcoin and the Ethereum. That is one of the gap we want to bridge. INFORMATION. Blockchain is a database system hence, its numerous application to other major sectors of the world like the healthcare, real estate, governance etc. is becoming widely accepted in the world. Its importance in the next decade cannot be over emphasized.
