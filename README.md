Introduction

This curriculum is designed for 12-weeks of learning and exploring different blockchain concepts, as well as developing decentralized applications on the blockchain. It is designed in such a way as to ensure the following :
That every student is actively carried along 
Students are able to measurably increase their confidence level at the end of the learning duration
Students are able to transition smoothly from web2.0 to web3.0
Students are able to show provable result for the skills acquired
Students are able to have a basic to intermediate knowledge on the Blockchain

Learning Paths :
Introduction to Blockchain
Developing Smart contract with solidity and truffle | Cryptocurrency Trading
Getting started with Web3Js / Etherjs
Blockchain Wallet Creation
Exploring DeFi
Understanding NFTs

Learning duration breakdown :

3 weeks of general blockchain introduction : 

Here all student attend this class before proceeding to a learning path of choice, mentors introduce the students to the Blockchain technology, open their eyes to different career and growth opportunities, basically anything to fuel passion

9 weeks of digging deep : 

Each learning path comprises 4 in-depth modules tailored specially for the students, each module spanning a total of 2weeks.
1 week for summary

2 weeks for final group task :

This is the final phase of the learning path, where students are tasked to build an MVP project and would be certified.

1 week for wrap up

Note : 
Mentors are expected to start each learning path with a concept to develop progressively and collectively  with the students as the different modules of a learning path / track are taught. With each module completing a task in the development of the concept. On completion of the learning path / track, there should be an MVP solution built collectively by all students, this is so as to build up the student confidence to take up the final certificate task.
