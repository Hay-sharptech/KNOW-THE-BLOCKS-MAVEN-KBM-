The scope of this project is to educate and provide a platform for young adult to get exposed to the blockchain technology especially the DAO system. 

- Educating and training young adults on the blockchain technology and its uses.
    1. This process will entail taking each student through three courses. They are the 
        1. Basic class that will run for a period of eight weeks with a curriculum running from the introduction to the internet taking a week, introduction to blockchain taking five weeks and a class project on creating a harsh and harsh utilization for two weeks.
        2. Intermediate class that will run for a period of eight weeks with a curriculum running from introduction to blockchain tools taking a week, block explorer, blockchain addresses and how they are created, wallet creation running for four weeks and a three weeks class project on wallet creation, transactions and gas fees.
        3. Master class that will also run for a period of eight weeks with a curriculum running from introduction to smart contracts taking two weeks, introduction to Decentralized Finance, Decentralized Autonomous Organization running for four weeks and a two weeks class project on creating a DAO. 
- Create ambassadors for KBM and Aragon from the best students of these training programs.
    - Students who have shown exemplary contributions in their conduct during the course of the training and are committed to helping spread the importance of early education of the blockchain technology will be given an opportunity to participate in the Aragon Ambassador program.
- Create an international student program where students from different part of the world can get to collaborate on different activities and projects pertaining to DAO functions and using Aragon products via test networks.

Introduction

This curriculum is designed for 8-weeks of learning and exploring different blockchain concepts, as well as developing decentralized applications on the blockchain. It is designed in such a way as to ensure the following :
That every student is actively carried along 
Students are able to measurably increase their confidence level at the end of the learning duration
Students are able to transition smoothly from web2.0 to web3.0
Students are able to show provable result for the skills acquired
Students are able to have a basic to intermediate knowledge on the Blockchain

Learning Paths :
Introduction to Blockchain
Developing Smart contract with solidity and truffle | Cryptocurrency Trading
Getting started with Web3Js / Etherjs
Blockchain Wallet Creation
Exploring DeFi
Understanding NFTs

Learning duration breakdown :

3 weeks of general blockchain introduction : 

Here all student attend this class before proceeding to a learning path of choice, mentors introduce the students to the Blockchain technology, open their eyes to different career and growth opportunities, basically anything to fuel passion

9 weeks of digging deep : 

Each learning path comprises 4 in-depth modules tailored specially for the students, each module spanning a total of 2weeks.
1 week for summary

2 weeks for final group task :

This is the final phase of the learning path, where students are tasked to build an MVP project and would be certified.



1 week for wrap up

Note : 
Mentors are expected to start each learning path with a concept to develop progressively and collectively  with the students as the different modules of a learning path / track are taught. With each module completing a task in the development of the concept. On completion of the learning path / track, there should be an MVP solution built collectively by all students, this is so as to build up the student confidence to take up the final certificate task.
