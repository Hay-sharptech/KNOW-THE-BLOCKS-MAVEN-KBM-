FRONTEND DEVELOPER CURRICULUM

Introduction

This curriculum is a 12-week deep dive into the various concepts that make up HTML, CSS & JavaScript. It is designed to build up your understanding on how the web works and enable you to build interactive, responsive websites. At the end of this curriculum, students will:

Understand the core concepts of the web and frontend development
Be confident in building websites from scratch
Be able to transition smoothly into using frontend frameworks e.g. React, Vue


Note:  Mentors are expected to start each learning path with a concept to develop progressively and collectively  with the students as the different modules of a learning path / track are taught. With each module completing a task in the development of the concept. On completion of the learning path / track, there should be an MVP solution built collectively by all students, this is so as to build up the student confidence to take up the final certificate task.

As the core of the formative action, this should be a basic to advanced Solidity course. Lessons must have a practical approach, combining theory and practical sessions. Students will use common tools like remix, truffle and Github to do practical exercises.
